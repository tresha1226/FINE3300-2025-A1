# FINE3300-2025-A1
This repository contains work from the first FINE 3300 assignment. In part 1, a "MortgagePayment" class is implemented in Python to calculate mortgage payments. In part 2, an "ExchangeRates" class is implemented to convert between USD and CAD. 

**Question 1: Mortgage Payments**
The mortgage payments are calculated using the principal, quoted interest rate, and amortization period. The interest rate is turned into an effective rate and semi-annual rate for different payment frequencies, then the present value of annuity formula is used to calculate the payment amounts. This is a quick and efficient way of comparing mortgage loan payment schedules. 

**Question 2: Exchange Rates**
In the second question, the CSV file saved in the folder is used to extract the data on the most recent exchange rates. Only the USD/CAD rates are used to convert the amounts ($100,000) provided by the user. A function is defined for the conversion where the user is prompted to provide the amounts. This is an interactive and quick way to convert currencies.
